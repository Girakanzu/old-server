/**
 * Message bus to route messages to their appropriate handler actors.
 * This is an implementation of the Reactor design pattern.
 *
 * Details:
 * When subscribing to a message, you actually subscribe to the classname of it.
 * This is because messages provide their classname as a 'type' field anyway, so we
 * can classify them that way easily. The class name does not need be read out by 
 * the usage of reflection at runtime when a message gets published.
 *
 * Usage:
 * This might be used with appropriate message handler actors. The message event carries
 * an additional field just for the purpose of giving the handler some kind of information
 * about the sender.
 * The sender actor is additionally wrapped to make it possible to identify it.
 * (Note that it needs to pass its identifier itself, so the sender is responsible for
 * any conflicts that might occur.)
